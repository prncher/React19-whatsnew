# This is a React 19 App using the release candidate

This project is not bootstrapped with [Create React App].
Only a primitive webpack config and babel file is present.
Goal of this project is to show the new features of React 19.

### Important: styled-components are not available with React 19.
So install using -force. This is tested on Safari, Chrome and FF. Also a "malformed URI" error can be seen while running the app. You may disregard this as more changes are needed in the webpack.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run build`

Build the project

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Tests are not available for now
